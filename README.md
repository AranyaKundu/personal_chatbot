# Personal Chatbot: This is how Jarvis began
This is a personal chatbot based on audio recognition. It also has an interface built in Tkinter.<br>
It is not based on any kind of Artificial Intelligence. It can only perform actions based on the functions written in the background.<br> 
As of now, the chat bot can perform any Google Search, Wikipedia search, tell your location and login to GroupMe.<br>
It has provision to add other functions and improve the performance of the chatBot.<br>
This is still a work in progress. I will keep additing more functionalities to the chatBot.
